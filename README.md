# nixos-pop-shell-template

A template for using Pop Shell within NixOS.

Heavily WIP, may change significantly.

## Licensing

[Pop! OS by System76](https://system76.com/pop/)
[NixOS by Nix Foundation](https://nixos.org)

The NixOS Logo is CC-BY-SA from the Nix foundation IIRC. I'll update this once I find the link.

All of the code and configuration in this template is licensed under MIT, meaning you can do whatever you want with it really, so long as you don't sue me if it breaks things.
