I googled NixOS wallpapers, trying to find an official one, and failed miserably. However, I did find one that reminded me of Pop! OS: https://wallpapercave.com/w/wp12329535

It appears to be crossposted on various wallpaper websites, such as:
- https://wallhere.com/en/wallpaper/2175173
- https://wallhaven.cc/w/z81l7g

etc.

I was unable to find the original source, nor the license. So uh, hopefully it's okay? If someone finds the original creator so it can be properly attributed, please let me know. I can also delete or replace it, ultimately it's just something for folks to replace with their own preferred wallpapers anyway. 🤷
