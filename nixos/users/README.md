# NixOS Users

This is where you define the user(s) for your NixOS configurations.

Most will only have a single user account, but if you have multiple people using your computer, or have something like a work account separate from your primary user, this is where they will be added.

This provides packages specific to each user, and is an entrypoint for home manager, which configures your dotfiles and other per-user settings like what's pinned to the dock.
